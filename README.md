# Codeway Snippets

## How Does The Story Indexing Work?
* When the story group changes, the algorithm always looks for the next/previous unseen story group and starts playing from the next unseen story.
* If the direction is to the right, the story player exits if there is no unseen story group in that direction.
* If the direction is to the left, the story player exits if there is no unseen story group in that direction.
* If all the stroy groups are seen and a story groups is tapped from home screen, the story player plays the stories of that story group respectively, and exits when the story group is ended.
